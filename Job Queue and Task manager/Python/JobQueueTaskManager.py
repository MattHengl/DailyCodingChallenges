#Having a system that is able to run multiple async based jobs at the same time
#Can keep a record of the things that are being ran
#Will need a way to start jobs
#Will need a way to monitor jobs
#Will need a way to log the different type of jobs
#Different type of jos(email, file process, data import, API calls)
#Sleep job, file copy job, data generator job, math calc job, random fail job
#Able to pause jobs and then restart them later, even after program has been restarted
